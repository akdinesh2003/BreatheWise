## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20 or later) and npm installed.

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

This project uses Google's Generative AI. You will need an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

1.  Create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of the project.
2.  Add your API key to the file:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    ```

    > **Important**: Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Google AI API key.

### 4. Running the Development Server

You need to run two separate processes: one for the Next.js frontend and one for the Genkit AI flows.

**Terminal 1: Run the Next.js app**

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the frontend on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

**Terminal 2: Run the Genkit AI flows**

```bash
npm run genkit:watch
```

This starts the Genkit development server, which handles the AI-powered features. The `--watch` flag automatically restarts the server when you make changes to the AI flows.

Now, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) to use the application.

### 5. Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

And to start the production server, run:

```bash
npm start
```
